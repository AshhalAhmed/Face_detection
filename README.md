üîç **Exploring Face Detection with OpenCV** üîç

---

### Project Overview:

Welcome to my latest project exploring the fascinating world of computer vision! In this project, I delved into the realm of face detection using OpenCV, a powerful library for image processing and computer vision tasks.

### Features:

- **Real-time Face Detection:** Utilizing OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier, the program detects faces in real-time through a webcam feed.
  
- **Text Overlay:** Enhance user experience with visual feedback! Each detected face proudly displays a "Face Detected" text overlay, showcasing the versatility of OpenCV for real-world applications.

### How to Run:

1. **Installation:**
   - Install Python if not already installed.
   - Install OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AshhalAhmed/face-detection.git
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   cd face-detection
   python face_detection.py
   ```

### Future Improvements:

- **Orientation Handling:** Explore techniques to improve face detection accuracy for rotated camera orientations.
  
- **Advanced Face Recognition:** Implement advanced techniques for face recognition and tracking in dynamic environments.
